    "lore1": "The 33 runes are the 33 Divine Words, spoken by the gods to trap themselves within the cube and forge the worldstone around it. The words range from the least powerful (El, the most generic magical essence) to the most powerful (Zod, the word of completion). These words were recorded and found to contain magical energy within themselves. By replicating these words on unique surfaces, with unique tools and the right amount of energy, people in all cultures and nations found ways to bind these words to small items, which became known as “runes.” \n",
    "lore2": "People who learned to do this became known as Runesmiths. Runesmiths can spend their whole lives training to manipulate their energy in certain ways to create and bind runes. As such it is rare to find them, for they are few and far in between. El is the simplest rune to craft, with only a couple of components and basic tools needed to craft them. Zod is a nearly impossible rune to craft, requiring materials lost to time and amounts of energy unseen on Haerra for a long time.\n",
    "lore3": "Humanoids are not the only ones to make use of runes. Many monsters are known to hoard runes, the magic of which draws on their primal instincts like lamps to moths. Dragons, known for their extensive treasure hoards, covet runes above all things--in addition to worldstone shards. Other, less intelligent creatures like wolves and even squirrels will collect runes and risk their lives to protect them. In the observation of many animals, the instinctual protectiveness of runes mirrors how they care for their children.\n",

Worldstone shards are a rare and highly coveted gem which form in seemingly “random” locations, as single shards or in small clusters. As such, it is impossible to establish worldstone shard mines. Similarly to runes, shards have a basic magical essence. As such, shards are often utilized by energy-users to fuel their more potent spells and creations (like power-cells for constructs, and in devices with runes to hold up the floating islands). Worldstone shards are unbreakable, however, they will lose their magical strength if taxed upon for a long time (for example: old shards must be exchanged for new ones occasionally in the devices that hold up floating islands).\n",
    "lore2": "**USING WORLDSTONE SHARDS**\n\nHaerrans use (and have used) shards in all manner of ways: from the jewelry of nobility to the devices powering Kilran golems. Historically, energy-users have harnessed shards to heighten their abilities. A group of ancient mana-users reportedly wore crowns of worldstone shards, and could choose to fully expend a shard to enhance their spells to catastrophic levels. Though this myth has never been replicated, the ancient tales still emphasize the importance of these shards. The use of worldstone shards is also not limited to humanoids: elementals, dragons, and other creatures horde shards. Their innate magic can result in all sorts of strange incidents: such as dire wolves with breath weapons of arcane energy and dragons with the ability to speak. Regardless of their use, peoples and creatures of all types are pulled to worldstone shards, whether for their beauty or the power they grant.\n",

    "lore1": "For all infinity the universe collapses and expands, forming and destroying worlds without pause. Normally these pass without remark. But eleven universes ago, godly beings came into existence who could control the rawest energy of the universe: simply called Source. Though once simple beings, they advanced beyond all expectation: eventually becoming omniscient and omnipotent. Despite this great power, however, they were not immortal. To survive the inevitable collapse of the universe, they channeled all their Source energy to transcend into the fourth dimension. However, in order to one day return to the physical realm, they needed an anchor. Before transcending, they engineered a powerful device known as the Metaverse Cube. They forged a protective barrier for the cube from the most powerful material in the universe: worldstone shards; a material that, with enough density, can even survive the collapse of a universe.\n\nWith a great amount of skill and a fair bit of luck, these beings trapped themselves within the Cube, shielding it with the Worldstone.\n",
    "lore2": "As ten universes passed without release from the cube, many of the gods became bitter and began to quarrel, breaking into factions. In this realm, gods died as mortals until only seven remained–each with their armies–isolated in their own factions. Among these, two continued their endless war: Eledon, god of Astra, and Azorag, god of Chaos.\n\nThis continued until, for the first time since its formation, the worldstone-encased cube finally crashed into a world teeming with the necessary tool for release: _life_. This world was named Haerra by its people. Although the Worldstone blocked the gods’ ability to directly interact with the physical world, they were able to influence people of Haerra with spiritual abilities, giving shards of Source nicknamed “sub-energies.”\n\nThe gods took this in different directions. Welarah happily granted mana energy to all who would seek it: birthing the mages. Isidor sought devout acolytes who would toil away working towards undeath, no matter the consequences. Eledon and Azorag continued their war on Haerra, gaining worshippers known as the Archons and Valburn Corruptors, respectively.\n",
    "lore3": "One god, however, thought differently. Zeno became fascinated with these humanoid individuals, who were reminiscent of the gods’ own kind. Zeno saw himself in many of them, and came to both love and pity these mortals who were unknowingly hurtling towards their demise. With only eight of the gods left, Zeno longed to start anew and enable these mortals with the power of Source energy. Understanding that the end of Haerra’s universe drew near, Zeno set his followers about gathering the necessary tools and energy to break the Worldstone and release the gods. Although other gods had become dulled by millennia of conflict and immortality, Zeno had hidden away from all of this, keeping memory and meticulous record of their entrapment in the Cube.\n",
    "lore4": "When Zeno came to the end of his project, he realized that the remaining gods simply did not have enough energy to destroy the Worldstone from within, even if he could gather and convince them collectively. The only way to produce enough energy was to sacrifice himself. Understanding the consequences and necessity of his path, Zeno destroyed himself and, with him, the Worldstone.\n\nWhen the Worldstone is destroyed, the gods are free to transfer back into the physical world of the universe instead of being trapped in the metaphysical world they built for themselves. Most of the gods have little interest in risking their immortality by entering the physical realm. Two, however, are more than eager: Azorag and Eledon see this as a unique opportunity to put an end to their conflict once and for all, for it is much easier to kill the other outside of the Cube than within. Both Azorag and Eledon see themselves as more than capable to win this conflict, a conflict which will scar Haerra for the rest of its short life.\n\nThe Cube is the gate between worlds, and it's now in your hands. What will you do?\n",

    "lore1": "By the year 620 R.H., the Elysium Mages and their fractal groups had grown immeasurably powerful. While the peoples of Haerra were developing the first compasses and squabbling over the ‘right’ ways to distill liquor, the mages had completed their floating metropolises, created and maintained universities, and learned to automate mechanical contraptions with mana energy. Viewing this massive rift in progress, some mages grew arrogant. Chief among these was Shadak Vaedra, an archmage and founder of the first arcane university on Haerra. He thought the ‘plight’ of the Haerrans could be solved under the guidance of magic, and he began to plant the seeds of a novel government he called “Magocracy,” or rulership of the mages. His idea–a council of mages who would dictate all the laws and affairs of Haerra–was a shocking proposition to many. However, many others were enamored by it: both power-mongers and idealists.\n\nOver a number of years, Archmage Vaedra’s philosophy grew rapidly in popularity–to the point where he began organizing meetings and grand symposiums to discuss the notions of magocracy. The arcanists opposed to this mage rulership–fearful that this rhetoric would lead to violence–congregated to deal with this issue. The opposition included most of the other archmages on the Council of Toralir. Their solution was a simple one: strip Shadak Vaedra of his archmage title and outlaw the notion of a magocracy entirely. Unbeknownst to them, this simple mandate would alter the course of Haerra’s history forever.\n",
    "lore2": "**THE FIRST MAGOCRACY WAR** (620 R.H. - 642 R.H.)\n\nWhen the Council of Toralir issued their law stripping Shadak Vaedra’s titles and banning discussion of a magocracy, the mage isles exploded into chaos. Vaedra had been an influential figure–not only in the magocracy–but for his contributions to both arcana and arcane study: founding Vaedra University and, in effect, the city of Toralir. Stripping him of his titles seemed too severe a punishment, and people turned against the Council of Toralir–even if they did not support a magocracy. Beyond these mages, however, this mandate gave Vaedra and his supporters the only reason they needed to act: and act they did. On the fateful eve of Haleshai 36th, 620 R.H., Vaedra and his supporters stormed the Council’s tower on Toralir, killing one archmage and capturing three others. The others fled, as did many other mages on Toralir, as the First Magocracy War broke out.\n\nThe war lasted a brutal twenty-two years, gutting the ranks of the mages and scarring civilians wherever battles broke out across Haerra. Eventually, a large majority of mages sided with the Council over Vaedra after witnessing his tyrannical behavior and the brutal executions of his adversaries. By the early months of 642, Vaedra and his followers were cornered in Toralir: their last stronghold. In a ‘final’ battle, a host of mages entered Toralir and laid waste to the city, killing, imprisoning, and exiling the Magocracy partisans. To set an example, the Council flew Vaedra–blanketed in chains–thousands of feet into the air and let him drop to the sea below, his restraints making it impossible to fly. His exiled followers bore away his broken remains and fled to the far reaches of Haerra.\n\n",
    "lore3": "**THE SECOND MAGOCRACY WAR **(c. 656 R.H.)\n\nFor many on Haerra, the end of the first war–then simply called the ‘Magocracy War’–was met with sighs of great relief. The mages began to rebuild Toralir and, with it, their civilization. Unbeknownst to them, however, the seeds of revolution still lingered. On the distant isles of the Forsaken Lands lay a deceased Vaedra. His most devout followers had made a deal with the Shade Warden, necromancer and lord of Urgavod, in a gamble to achieve the impossible: resurrecting Vaedra. Fourteen long years passed without results, until a ritual was attempted to fuse Vaedra’s now-skeletal body with the souls of his ten most devout followers. When the ritual was complete and the ten followers were drained of their life forces, the first undead mage–called a Lich–was born. Vaedra rose, skeletal body wreathed with his old mage robes, consciousness returned to him. This time, however, his idea of Magocracy lacked the idealism: positing himself as the supreme king of Haerra.\n\nVaedra left Urgavod alongside a small host of followers and sent for the Council of Toralir to meet him on the Plains of Zakraad. A horrified and disbelieving Council immediately departed, alongside a number of other mages, to destroy this ‘Vaedra imposter.’ But when they arrived, they were met with a single figure–the imposing skeletal visage of Vaedra stood alone, surrounded by the siphoned bodies of his followers. In the ensuing Battle of Zakraad (the only battle in the ‘Second Magocracy War’), Vaedra reportedly stood “entirely still” the whole time, obliterating any mage who neared with an effortless word or gesture. It appeared that he was using both mana and ichor energy–something never thought possible by a single individual. As the hosts of mages set upon him, Vaedra appeared as though he would be overwhelmed. In an act of desperation, he struck the ground with a palm. The earth within hundreds of miles trembled and exploded, creating deep rifts across the Plains of Zakraad. The tremendous force decimated the area and triggered volcanic eruptions all along Valburn. As the skies filled with ash and darkness in the time known as Valburn’s Long Night, the mages warred against Vaedra. Finally, they overcame him–supposedly with a single lucky disintegration ray. Around the obliterated body of Vaedra lay the bodies of a hundred mages, with many more wounded.\n",
