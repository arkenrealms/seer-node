    "shortDescription": "Positioned on the outer rings of the solar system, this planet flourishes with energy-wielding life.",
    "description": "A beautiful planet filled with flourishing life, Haerra thrums with energy and activity. With only one known continent stretching across its broad surface, the varied types of life on Haerra are--by necessity--heavily intertwined. During the day, Gamon's red and blue stars, Jiron and Isro, fill the sky with multicolored light. Haerra's nearby moon, Oris, can also be seen looming in the sky on clear days. At night, blue-tinted light fills the dark skies when Oris is opposite Isro, and red-tinted when opposite Jiron.\n"
